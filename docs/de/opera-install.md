Opera officially provides an extension called [Install Chrome Extensions](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/install-chrome-extensions/) that you can use to install Authenticator from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/authenticator/bhghoamapcdpbohphigoooaddinpkbai).

Please note that we don't test Authenticator in Opera. You may encounter bugs. If you have an issue in Opera, please [open a bug report](https://github.com/Authenticator-Extension/Authenticator/issues/new/choose).
