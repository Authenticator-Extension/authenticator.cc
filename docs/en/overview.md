Authenticator Extension is a browser-extension-based OTP (One-time Password) authenticator client. Authenticator Extension supports both Time-based One-time password (TOTP, specified in [RFC 6238](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238)) and HMAC-based One-time password (HOTP, specified in [RFC 4226](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226)).

Authenticator Extension can authenticate with the same sites and processes as Google Authenticator, but it is not a Google official product.
